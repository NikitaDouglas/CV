## Nikita Douglas

Iâ€™m a personable, energetic, and creative Operations Analyst turned Junior Software Developer. I'm also [a writer](www.nikitadouglas.com), a gardener, and a crafter. I graduated from Oxford with a BA in English Literature in 2019, and launched into my career in the Technology sector with a customer-focused operations role at a fintech startup. Driven by a desire to affect still more change, and a longstanding interest in coding, in April 2020 I started Makers Academy, a 16 week intensive coding bootcamp, and am now seeking a varied backend role in an Agile company.  

## Skills

#### Excellent communicator

Whilst at Cleo AI, I updated and wrote new articles for our [Help Center](https://faqs.meetcleo.com/en/), teaching our customers how to use the product, as well as answering cutomer queries. As the needs of the company grew, I was instrumental in translating that knowledge to our in-house training manual on Atlassian Confluence, and in training new members of the Operations team, due to my personable and friendly nature. 

#### Customer Focused

I champion the needs and wants of the customer - I excelled at providing friendly and outgoing service in various front-of-house roles in the hospitality sector. During my time at Cleo AI, I worked closely with our developers to ensure that individual customer issues were addressed with empathy and tact - a critical focus when personal finances are in question. I thrived in liaisng between the two groups to ensure that issues were raised and addressed in a timely manner.

#### Organised

I am unapologetically intense in my approach to organisation - whilst at University I managed my degree, various roles and commitments in socieities, and a part-time job, and to this day I see fear and awe in people's eyes when they look at my Google Calendar. On starting in the corporate world I successfully balanced the many and various commitments of my role in a busy startup by curating my own weekly timetable, which was key in avoiding time-lost due to context switching, and achieving that paradisiacal state of the corporate world - flow. 

#### Neophilic

I'm instatiable curious; I love the new, the shiny, the novel. In my working life this manifests as a willingness to turn my hands to all things, be that ad hoc Facebook Marketing for the pub in which I was bartending, or single-handedly building a Google Sheets based Content Management Database for Cleo AI's Help Center articles. I am at my best when working in fast-paced, Agile environments, in which no two days are alike. I love hats and I like to wear lots of different ones.
